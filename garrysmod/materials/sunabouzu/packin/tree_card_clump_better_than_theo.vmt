//hey anyone who checks this please render your 2d billboard assets against a background that is the same color as the asset.
//the reason these textures are broken normally is because they use $translucent because they get really gross alpha artifacting on it otherwise.
//but like my dude all you need to do is not fucking render your fake ass 2d tree painting on a neutral gray background. goddamn. im mad if you couldnt tell.
//spent 2 hours trying to make it look good with the actual textures but fuck me running thats a tall ask.
//hell im a wizard at the source engine so i feel like i get to drag ex-valve employees a good 15 years after the game half life 2 is released.
